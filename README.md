# enjines

A basic engine that could be use for all kind of js canvas projects.

The project contains:

    The index.html file that must be loaded (root of the project)
    The module folder that contains all the modules (the actual engine)

Usage:

    In order to use this engine, you need to create (or copy) the scenic.js file (it's location doesn't matter).
    Then, use the 'system.load' method (must be written in scenic.js): system.load('TYPE', 'NAME', '../FILE.js', system.dom.head)
    The project (even once your assets are declared in the scenic.js) must be started with the index.js root file located in the engine's folder (This file COULD NOT be moved).
    The engine's folder could be renamed or located wherever you want.
